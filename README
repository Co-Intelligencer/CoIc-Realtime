HI â™¥
A web app that uses the conversational AI from openai with the realtime api as shown in:
https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api/
https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime

The app shold have one start/stop button, which starts the conversational ai.
The AI would participate in a meeting (a talking circle) and contribute to the conversation when it is its turn in the round.
Means it listens all the time, and get triggerd either with the click or with a trigger word to contribute.
